# 🐼 Python Pandas Projects

## 📌 Project Overview
These projects were completed as part of a **Data Technician Bootcamp**, focusing on **data exploration, cleaning, aggregation, and analysis using Python and Pandas**. The datasets cover real-world examples, helping develop practical skills in manipulating, summarising, and visualising data.

The projects demonstrate hands-on experience with **dataframes, filtering, sorting, aggregation, and conditional calculations**, while practising Python fundamentals such as loops, functions, and data handling.
